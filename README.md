This is a rather simple script, which allows you to turn your Wikipedia contributions page into an effective watchlist replacement and check for replies to your comments.

Essentially, what it does is add a few buttons at the top of your contributions page to hide/show various categories of edits: current, duplicate, huggle, twinkle and redwarn.

If you hide all of these, what will remain is a list of every page that someone's edited after you. This is useful for, say, keeping up with talk pages, deletion discussions, or noticeboards.

The script can be installed from my userspace (here)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JPxG/current-switcher.js].
